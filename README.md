# Draft Nilvo's Cup

## Description

This is a website I made just to present to our playerbase of monday's soccer championship called Nilvo's cup team draft. The idea is just drag and hover the players from the list to at the end have all the players separated trough six teams.

## Requirements

-  Node.Js installed

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Improvements

This is a MVP product, made with the resources I had access trough a small amount of hours per day. The idea of the product is to validate if the draft will make a balanced and fun cup for everyone. So the design is very bad, we are using background images and this is bothering me so much. When I have more time I will improve this to add just a texture and write everything from the images on the website. Also do some improvements on the future,for example, a way of more than one person change the teams. Right now I just focus on the basic features and saving into the browser to avoid data loss
